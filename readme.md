## 		Overview

/--------/--------/--------/


The HTML (markup) is setup into components, located in the 'library/partials' folder.

Each component's HTML is not to be modified.

The corresponding SCSS should be located in the 'library/__source/css/project' folder, which will compile automatically into Grunt, after the vendor files (and in alphebetical order)

Any third party CSS or JS should be loaded through bower (where possible), otherwise they should exists in the corresponding third-party folders under JS and CSS.
